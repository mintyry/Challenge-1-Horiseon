# Horiseon Solution Services Refactor

## Description

Horiseon's website allows potential users to see what services they provide.

Client wanted to refactor code as to add accessibility to their webpage.

I refactored this project to not only meet client's desires, but to also increase accessibility, which would also enhance SEO for this SEO company.

Refactoring solved the problem of accessibility by adding semantic elements as well as alt attributes for those who cannot access webpages normally. Also, refactoring allowed the ability to clean up what would be otherwise very redundant coding.

In this project, I learned how to make webpages much more accessible. I learned how to clean up code by consolidating various selectors. I also learned how to make sure links can jump to specific areas of a webpage.

After refactoring code for this webpage, users can now access this website in a more optimized way that is convenient for more audiences.

Please enjoy the deployed [application](https://mintyry.github.io/First-Challenge-Horiseon/)!

This site for Horiseon allows for potential customers to see what Horiseon has to offer.

For more convenient accessibility, users can simply click on any of the three links in the navigation bar to view their corresponding content of information.

Additionally, we have specified areas all throughout the page that are organized for a user using a screen reader. Utilizing such, a reader will find that they are in the body of the webpage or the aside and many other sections the webpage contains. Images also have alternative descriptions should the user not be able to view the actual image itself.

The following screenshots demonstrates how to use the provided links to go to specific content:

Simply click on the link whose section you'd like to jump to with your mouse cursor.
